A web developer needs to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web pageâ€™s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

    The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.
    The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.
    The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.

Return an array [L, W] where L and W are the length and width of the web page you designed in sequence.

 

Example 1:

Input: area = 4
Output: [2,2]
Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.

Example 2:

Input: area = 37
Output: [37,1]

Example 3:

Input: area = 122122
Output: [427,286]

 

Constraints:

    1 <= area <= 10^7

class Solution {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        int[] res = new int[2]; 
        
        int w = (int) Math.sqrt(area);
        
        while(area%w !=0) {
            w--; 
        }
        
        int l = area/w; 
        res[0] = l; 
        res[1] = w; 
        
        return res;
    }
}

class Solution2 {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        int maxdiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int[] res = new int[2];
        for(int i=1;i<=Math.sqrt(area);i++){
            if(area%i==0){
                // System.out.print(i+" ");
                if((area/i-i)<maxdiff){
                    res[0]=area/i;
                    res[1]=i;
                    maxdiff = area/i-i;
                    
                }
            }
        }
        return res;
    }
}
